He mentions that the lost tribes of Israel may have settled in Kashmir. The author also introduces St. Thomas as one of Jesuss closest friends and Mary Magdalene as a woman from the ancient Mauryan Empire headed by Ashoka. The book further features terrorist attacks that share some parallels with the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Sanghis hypothesis goes on to establish that Jesuss descendants are todays Kashmiri Islamists.

Dilip Kumar was born as Yousuf Khan. He started as a shy rookie in Hindi cinema in the early 1940s and there was no looking back. He went on to reach the zenith of stardom within a short period of time. He delivered mesmerizing performances in one hit movie after another, in a row! His almost sixdecadelong career as an actor was based only on his original ability, unwavering willpower, sheer hard work and diehard optimistic attitude. In this book, Dilip Kumar tells us his journey right from his birth, his days as an aspiring actor, his ascent to the pinnacle of success and the rest, to the present day. He frankly narrates his relationships with different variety of people. His interactions were not only restricted to his family, friends and the film world but also with businessmen and politicians. Dilip Kumar sets the record straight about how he got married to Saira Banu, one of the then Bollywood beauties. He feels that a lot of what was written about him so far is mostly misinterpreted, and so he narrates, in graphic detail, about his romantic relationship and marriage, which pretty much reads like a fairy tale! He fondly remembers the event that changed his life forever his meeting with Devika Rani, the boss of the famous Bombay Talkies, and being offered an acting job. His first film was Jwar Bhata (1944). He explains how he had to learn the whole kit and caboodle from scratch and how he had to cultivate his own individual dramatics and panache that would set him apart from his contemporaries. He soon scaled great heights with movies like Jugnu, Shaheed, Mela andaz, Deedar, Daag and Devdas. In most of his movies he played the tragedian with such a matchless intensity that his mind was undesirably affected. He had to consult a British psychiatrist, who counselled him to shift to play comedy. The consequence was his remarkable performances in the hilarious, laugh riots like Azaad and Kohinoor, apart from an amusing depiction as a resolute Tongdriver in Naya Daur. He then took a fiveyear break and later began his second innings with Kranti in 1981, post which he acted in successions of hits such as Vidhaata, Karma, Saudagar, Mashaal, Shakti, and Qila.', 'English', 450, 500),

Its also better to get a general undergraduate degree than go for a programme that restricts future options, if ones unsure where ones heart lies. If a student has an interest in more than one course, they should choose the one that has a broader scope. The possibility of doing post-graduation in that subject is then higher, since fewer seats are available at the postgraduate level.

Her boss, private detective Cormoran Strike, is less surprised but no less alarmed. There are four people from his past who he thinks could be responsible - and Strike knows that any one of them is capable of sustained and unspeakable brutality. With the police focusing on the one suspect Strike is increasingly sure is not the perpetrator, he and Robin take matters into their own hands and delve into the dark and twisted worlds of the other three men. But as more horrendous acts occur, time is running out for the two of them... A fiendishly clever mystery with unexpected twists around every corner, Career of Evil is also a gripping story of a man and a woman at a crossroads in their personal and professional lives.
