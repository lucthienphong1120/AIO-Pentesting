# Pentesting Stages

## 1. Reconnaissance

+ Google (specifically Google Dorking)
+ Wikipedia
+ Social Media (Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook)
+ PeopleFinder.com
+ who.is
+ sublist3r
+ hunter.io
+ builtwith.com
+ wappalyzer
+ dnsdumpster.com
+ shodan.io
+ builtwith.com
+ dnsdumpster.com

## 2. Scanning & Enumeration

+ nmap (scan a target and tell us a wide variety of things)
+ dirb (used to find commonly-named directories on a website)
+ dirbuster (similar to dirb but with a cooler name, and with a user interface)
+ enum4linux (tool used specifically for Linux to find vulnerabilities)
+ metasploit (this tool is mostly used for exploitation, but it also has some built-in enumeration tools)
+ Burp Suite (this tool can be used to scan a website for subdirectories and to intercept network traffic)

## 3. Exploitation

+ Metasploit (many built-in scripts to try)
+ Burp Suite (exploit web applications)
+ SQLMap (exploit web applications)
+ msfvenom (for building custom payloads)
+ BeEF (browser-based exploitation)

## 4. Privilege Escalation

+ Windows: Administrator or System. (pwdump7, Ophcrack)
+ Linux: root

## 5. Covering Tracks & Reporting

+ The Finding(s) or Vulnerabilities
+ The CRITICALITY of the Finding
+ A description or brief overview of how the finding was discovered
+ Remediation recommendations to resolve the finding
