# AIO-Pentesting

> All in one Pentest methodologies - **Tools and commands**

> *Where compiled all common materials for pentester*

In this document, I will divide it into 2 phases and an overview is listed after below:

+ Pre-Intrusion
  - Windows (To do) :x:
  - [Linux](./Pre-Intrusion-Linux.md) :heavy_check_mark:
+ Intrusion
  - Windows (To do) :x:
  - [Linux](./Intrusion-Linux.md) :heavy_check_mark:

:warning: Below is the full roadmap, and be sure to check it out first

# Overview

## 1. Reconnaissance

+ Google (specifically Google Dorking)
+ Wikipedia
+ Social Media (Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook)
+ PeopleFinder.com
+ who.is
+ sublist3r
+ hunter.io
+ builtwith.com
+ wappalyzer
+ dnsdumpster.com
+ shodan.io
+ builtwith.com
+ dnsdumpster.com

## 2. Scanning & Enumeration

+ nmap (scan a target and tell us a wide variety of things)
+ dirb (used to find commonly-named directories on a website)
+ dirbuster (similar to dirb but with a cooler name, and with a user interface)
+ enum4linux (tool used specifically for Linux to find vulnerabilities)
+ metasploit (this tool is mostly used for exploitation, but it also has some built-in enumeration tools)
+ Burp Suite (this tool can be used to scan a website for subdirectories and to intercept network traffic)

## 3. Exploitation

+ Metasploit (many built-in scripts to try)
+ Burp Suite (exploit web applications)
+ SQLMap (exploit web applications)
+ msfvenom (for building custom payloads)
+ BeEF (browser-based exploitation)

## 4. Privilege Escalation

+ Windows: Administrator or System. (pwdump7, Ophcrack)
+ Linux: root

## 5. Covering Tracks & Reporting

+ The Finding(s) or Vulnerabilities
+ The CRITICALITY of the Finding
+ A description or brief overview of how the finding was discovered
+ Remediation recommendations to resolve the finding

# Useful documents

## CVE Databases

1. [NVD (National Vulnerability Database)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/full-listing)
2. [Exploit-DB](http://exploit-db.com/)
3. [CVE MITRE](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/)

## OS binaries libraries

1. [GTFOBins of Unix binaries](https://gtfobins.github.io/)
2. [LOLBAS of Windows binaries](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)

## Build-in useful tools

```sh
tree /usr/share/webshells/
tree /usr/share/wordlists/
```

## Real cyber attack kill chains

1. Getting in
2. Hacking through
3. Taking it out
